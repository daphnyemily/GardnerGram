What I learned: Social media apps can be fairley easy to make, although each piece really ties into each other. Still learning how to get the best result from my routes to maximize efficiency. 

What I still need to work on: I got stuck with the CSS on the specific post page since the URL is based on each individual user ID. Always a minor road block, will find the solution and update.
